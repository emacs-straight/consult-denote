1 Version 0.2.0 on 2024-09-15
═════════════════════════════

1.1 The command `consult-denote-find' always previews files
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  This command will search for matching file names through the
  `denote-directory'. It now previews the selected file in the
  minibuffer, whereas before the preview had to be triggered manually.

  Remember that you can customise what command is actually called, per
  `consult-denote-find-command' (default is `consult-find', with
  `consult-fd' as another likely choice).


1.2 The commands `denote-find-link' and `denote-find-backlink' have previews
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  This is relevant when `consult-denote-mode' is enabled. This mode
  makes changes in the background to make all file-related Denote
  minibuffer prompts have the preview functionality. The idea is that
  users keep the same workflow and overall style, while benefiting from
  the added features.

  Thanks to hapst3r for suggesting something similar which made me
  realise those commands were not actually covered by
  `consult-denote-mode'.

  [ If there are more Denote commands that you think could benefit from
    `consult-denote-mode' but are not covered yet, please let me know. ]


1.3 The package now has a manual and change log
───────────────────────────────────────────────

  You can find the relevant source files in consult-denote.git and their
  web pages on my website.

2 Version 0.1.0 on 2024-07-03
═════════════════════════════

  The `consult-denote' provides glue code to integrate `denote' with
  Daniel Mendler’s `consult' package. The idea is to enhance minibuffer
  interactions, such as by providing a preview of the file-to-linked or
  opened and by adding more sources to the `consult-buffer' command.
  Interested users can enable the `consult-denote-mode' to get started.


2.1 Familiar minibuffer prompts
───────────────────────────────

  `consult-denote' is designed to enhance all relevant Denote prompts
  with whatever extras Consult provides, such as the preview facility.
  These Consult-powered minibuffer prompts will still follow the same
  patterns of interaction as core Denote: they will never use a
  profoundly different presentation.


2.2 Customise what `consult-buffer' shows from Denote
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The extra sources added to the `consult-buffer' command are controlled
  by the user option `consult-denote-buffer-sources'. Its default value
  is the list of sources called `consult-denote-all-buffer-sources'.


2.3 Developed in tandem with Denote
───────────────────────────────────

  My goal with this package is to keep it as close to Denote as
  possible. If the community wants a new feature, we can discuss whether
  a variant of it makes sense for `denote' before considering its
  inclusion in `consult-denote'.
